## 概要

- This paper explores the challenges of clock synchronization with PTP and proposes a hardware architecture that combines, a hardware IEEE 1588-2008 clock adjustment unit together with a PTP message recognition and timestamping unit
- The implementation and evaluation described in this paper is built around the open-source platform T-CREST
- The proposed implementation achieves sub-microsecond clock synchronization with a worst-case offset of 138 ns.
